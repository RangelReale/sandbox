class Servlet_API UnavailableException : public ServletException 
{
	/// Defines an exception that a servlet or filter throws to indicate that it is permanently
	/// or temporarily unavailable.
	/// When a servlet or filter is permanently unavailable, something is wrong with it,
	/// and it cannot handle requests until some action is taken. For example, a servlet
	/// might be configured incorrectly, or a filter’s state may be corrupted. The component
	/// should log both the error and the corrective action that is needed.
	/// A servlet or filter is temporarily unavailable if it cannot handle requests momentarily
	/// due to some system-wide problem. For example, a third-tier server might
	/// not be accessible, or there may be insufficient memory or disk storage to handle
	/// requests. A system administrator may need to take corrective action.
	/// Servlet containers can safely treat both types of unavailable exceptions in the
	/// same way. However, treating temporary unavailability effectively makes the servlet
	/// container more robust. Specifically, the servlet container might block requests
	/// to the servlet or filter for a period of time suggested by the exception, rather than
	/// rejecting them until the servlet container restarts.
